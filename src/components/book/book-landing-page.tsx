                Over 20+ years, I&rsquo;ve worked as a designer and a leader in tech, in companies
                dominated by big personalities with strong opinions and loud voices.

              For years, I pretended to be an extrovert at work to fit the “extrovert ideal”. And it
              worked. But I was also exhausted, because I was pretending to be someone I was not.

              The Quiet Achiever is a collection of the tiny habits I developed to have impact and
              influence at work while remaining my true authentic self. Since then, I&rsquo;ve coached nearly
              a thousand quiet achievers with success. Now, I share these tiny habits with you in my
              book.
